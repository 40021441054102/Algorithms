## How to Run ?
First You Must Clone ```RKACPB``` Repository which is My Automatic C++ Project Builder by :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamtinKosari/RKACPB.git
```
Then, Go to RKACPB by ```cd RKACPB``` and Do this Command
```bash
./build.sh --packages "OpenCV;X11"
```
This will Automatically Build the Project, then You have to Go to the ```build``` Directory Created in Base Directory and Do this Command :
```bash
./run
```
